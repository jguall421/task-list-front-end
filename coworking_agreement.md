Makiko: Share blockers if we have any and communicate our working status via slack.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

Live share when coworking during round table time
If we don't get done during class, we can divide work and set goals for what to get done & when

Jesica: Live code works well during class time and then letting team memerge conflicts. Initial communication done via Slack but if it complicated then video call is prefferd.
